config/settings.py
==================
Central configuration for the Vision-Based Assembly Monitoring System.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
  Instead of writing numbers like "threshold = 20" scattered across different
  files, ALL configurable values live here. If you want to change something,
  you change it in ONE place and it automatically updates everywhere.

  This matches the Configuration subsystem (SS10) from the system architecture
  in File 5 — "Provides settings to all subsystems".

HOW TO USE:

# Change to 1 or 2 if Logitech is not the default device.

# Resolution at 640x480 — sufficient for V1 motion detection.
# Higher resolution = more detail but slower processing.
